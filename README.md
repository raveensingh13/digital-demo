## React Test

We need to build a interface for our marketplace concept in React. We've put together a simple product list in the `projects.json` file and we need your help to build a UI around it.

Your requirements for this component:

1. Build a product list page, as well as view and edit pages for each item.
2. The product list must be searchable, filterable and sortable.
3. The product list must be paginated, but should load more as the user scrolls down the page.
4. The product list must be built from scratch and not contain any extraneous functionality not applicable to this test.
5. You may use any type of storage to save the product data, but it should persist between sessions.
6. EXTRA: Add a simple login/logout function (authentication not required)
7. EXTRA: Track user views of a certain product in the list

Complete steps 6 and 7 if time allows.
